<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: …amazing. It actually worked!
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling_closed>>
MsMeta: I’m in the past. I traveled through time. And I made it in one piece!
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: Huh. Justice City looks…different in 1942.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: And no sign of Arachdroid anywhere. That’s bad news. What if they’ve already started messing with history?

<<setActors DialogueManager MsMeta null Max>> 

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Max: Well, the fabric of reality hasn’t unravelled yet, so I think we’ve still got breathing room.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: Max!
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor pleased>>
Max: Hey, Army, this is the year 2020 on the line. Good to hear you’re okay. Any joy yet?
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: No, sorry. There’s no sign of Arachdroid.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral>>
MsMeta: And Justice City looks so different in 1942, I’m not even sure how to get to the old Harbor Shipyard, let alone stop them from interfering in the biggest punch-up in superhero history.
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Max: Hang tight. I’ll send you a map.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: You can do that?
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Yeah, the prototype Time Engine you got doesn’t have a built-in historical variator like the version Arachdroid stole, so I’ll hard-code you one. I’ll have to account for some mathematical variables based off Grandma’s research on temporal displacement and my own work on P versus NP.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smirking>>
MsMeta: So long as it gets me where I need to go, I don’t care how it works.
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor pleased_closed>>
Max: Heh. They teach you that in USACE? Anyway, here it comes.
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Press [PLAYER INTERACTION BUTTON] to bring up the map.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad>>
MsMeta: It’s…kind of a mess.
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Huh. It…shouldn’t be. I accounted for the Time Engine’s temporal distortion mechanics.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
MsMeta: I’ll see if I can get it working.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor smiling>>
MsMeta: Okay, I think I’ve got it.
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor smiling>>
Max: Nice work!
<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor smiling>>
Max: Now all you’ve got to do is follow the arrows.
<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor sad_speaking>>
MsMeta: What arrows?

<<setActors DialogueManager MsMetaRight null Max>>

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight neutral>>
MsMetaRight: It’s one of Arachdroid’s spider drones!

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Seriously? What’s it doing?

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight neutral_speaking>>
MsMetaRight: It’s just wandering around…

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Oh. I’ve seen that before. ‘Patrol mode’, it’s called. That means Alex must be somewhere nearby.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad>>
MsMetaRight: ‘Alex’…you mean Arachdroid.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight neutral>>
MsMetaRight: …I’ll try talking to it. Maybe it knows where they are.

<<setActors DialogueManager SpiderDrone MsMetaRight null>>

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight smiling_closed>>
MsMetaRight: Hey there, little guy!

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight smiling>>
MsMetaRight: Where’s your maker? 
SpiderDrone: …

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad_speaking>>
MsMetaRight: Whoa! Hold up! We don’t have to fight.

SpiderDrone: DESTROY DESTROY attack DESTROY

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad>>
MsMetaRight: …okay, so, I guess you think we do have to fight.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActor angry closed mouth>>
MsMeta: It didn’t have to be like this. I hate having to fight robots.

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor angry>>
Max: Mm. Did it just call you a scrub? I’m gonna have a word with Alex about that.

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: Once you’ve finished stopping them from destroying reality as we know it, I mean. Priorities.

<<setActors DialogueManager null MsMetaRight Max>>

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral_speaking>>
Max: Hey, Meta, your passive proximity scanner just sent back a ping.

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor neutral>>
Max: Keep going where you’re going, you’re getting closer to Alex with every step.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad>>
MsMetaRight: Uh…about that.

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
Max: What’s wrong?

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad_speaking>>
MsMetaRight: If I keep going where I’m going, I’m going to end up walking into the business end of a bayonet.

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight angry_closed>>
MsMetaRight: On a scale of one to ten, how well do you think a couple of military police in the early 1940s would react to a black woman walking up to them, asking them to let her into a secured military installation?

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried_speaking>>
Max: Meta, where are you?

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight sad>>
MsMetaRight: I’m outside the gates of the Justice City Naval Shipyard. They’re guarded, but…Arachdroid can fly.

<<setExpression MaxDialogueActor angry>>
Max: Forget that. Find another way in. How high is the wall?

<<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight neutral>>
MsMetaRight: Normally, it wouldn’t be a problem, but I can’t jump as high as I usually can…I don’t know why. If I wanted to get past it, I’d need to find something close to my height to get up on.

-> “FIGHT”
    <<setExpression MaxDialogueActor worried>>
    Max: Do not do that. Bad, bad idea. I know you could take these dudes down, but we have to get Alex out of the past with as little collateral damage as possible.
    [[115.1]]
-> “WALK AWAY”
    <<setExpression MsMetaDialogueActorRight neutral_speaking>>
    MsMetaRight: You’re right, forget this. I’m going to find another way in. I just need to find something about my height, then I can jump over that wall no problem…
